Checkpoint 1:
- Compilation error with paing.C and paging.S
       Fixed by changing the name of the file
- Keyboard interrupts only working once
-RTC interrupts not being received
     Both were fixed by fixing an inequality sign in the PIC initialization

Checkpoint 2:

- Brock saw a sowbug in his bathtub on Wednesday, October 24th.
- Keyboard not adding newline to vc_buffer
   fixed by adding line to code that copies the vc_buffer over correctly
-Shift / caps functionality
   Made sure when capslock and shift were both set, lower case letters were printed
-Keyboard functionality issues
   Shift was not working
   No | or \
   Capslock prints psecial characters that should only be printed with shift
   Shift is enter and enter does not work
   
   These issues were resolved by adding the mapping for all remaining characters
   We added a separate conditional case for shift and expanded the keyboard buffer 
   to its proper size of 256
   
-Keyboard makes "hole" terminal after scrolling
   fixed by preventing keyboard from writing "\n" as a character to the screen
   
-Enter breaking keyboard echo
   fixed by altering a faulty if statement that was causing the buffer index to overflow
   
-Capslock printing special character
    created separate mapping for capslock so it did not print special characters

Checkpoint 3:

- Mike saw a cockroach in the Union South Lounge on Wednesday, October 31st.

- Calling execute crashes the system
      - fixed by updating assembly linkage at the end of execute

- Execute does not save EBP and ESP correctly
      - Caused by compiler not compiling assembly linkage correctly,
        had to change writing of assembly

Checkpoint 4:

- Vidmap page faults when called
      - Caused by paging structures not being set up correctly /
        not having the correct permissions

- Get args returns the wrong arguments
      - Caused by accidentally writing the whole command into the
        argdat array

- Some non-alphanumeric keyboard keys fill the keyboard buffer
  with garbage
      - fixed by limiting what keys can put values into the keyboard buffer

Need to change:
- rtc not being cat properly
- user crash does not return to the kernel
- write and read should directly call on the function instead of switch of fd

Checkpoint 5:
- for typing in current display terminal, it actually wrote to the currently running one's memory
    - need to do the re map paging so that it shortly mapping the currently running process's vidmem to the currently displaying process's vidmem and then switch it back when it returned
    - flush the tlb when it did the termial switch
    - might be a fix: map the vidmem of backup vidmem below 3MB in the physical memory
- Xinyi saw a cockroach on the stair of Krannert Center on Friday, November 30th.
- Brock saw a wolf spider outside his apartment building on Thursday, December 6th

- When a background program closes the OS crashes
      - caused by OS actually halting the currently shown program, not the
        currently running program.

- RTC seems to lag and jitter when multiple programs are using it
      - caused by all programs using the same RTC flag. Changing the
        flag into an array solves this problem

- Video memory swapping does not work correctly, copies the wrong values
      - Caused by not flushing the TLB correctly when changing paging structures
